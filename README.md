# Bookmarking Tool
Switching to an OOP approach, redoing the project.

Starting with User Story 1: As a user I want to bookmark an URL

User Story 1a: The URL must be valid

User Story 2: As a user I want to be able to Tag a URL with a keyword

User Story 3: As a user when I add a duplicate bookmark, I want the system to increase the rating of that bookmark, because no exact duplicates should exist

User Story 4: As a user I want to know how many of my bookmarks are secure URLs

User Story 5: As a user I want a new bookmark to become associated with other bookmarks that are from the same domain

User Story 6: As a user I want to be able to filter bookmarks by one keyword

**User Story 7: !!!ToDo!!!**

User Story 8: As a user I want to remove a TAG from a bookmark

User Story 9: As a user I want to remove a URL bookmark

User Story 10: As a user I want to add a current date/time when I add a bookmark

User Story 11: As a user I want to list my bookmarks sorted by rating (highest to smallest)

User Story 12: As a user I want to list my bookmarks sorted by date (newer to older)
